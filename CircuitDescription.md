Please pardon the hand drawn skematic. I'm still trying to get the lastest version of Eagle to run.
The skematic has three parts: three (of N) channels of input, four input conditioning options for one voltage and three current measuring options and some common circuitry for making buffered refeerence voltages.
The input channels are all the same and consist of an opamp based integrator (U1 and C1), a comparitor (U2), a "D" style flip flop (U4) and a tristate buffer (U3).
Each channel feeds a succesive approximation
